# fact-checking
This project compares Snopes and PolitiFact fact-checked claims using text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, toxicity and sentiment analysis, K-means clustering, and topic modelling (LDA). The goal is to identify dominant misinformation themes across Real, Mixed, and Fake claims and evaluate how different methods capture semantic structure.
